## Calculator

 - This repository is using the latest React version and its new hooks features.

 - Test coverage is using Enzyme with Jest.

 - Styled-component for styles

 The goal was to use the same UX as the Android Calculator what makes the code slighly more complex than an usual calculator.

 There are bugs still to be fixed to make the chosen UX work properly.
